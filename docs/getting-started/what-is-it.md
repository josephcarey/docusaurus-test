# wtf is west coast swing?

West coast swing (or sometimes 'modern swing' or 'street swing') is a modern evolution of traditional swing. It's danced to a huge variety of music, from modern top 40, to acoustic covers of classic songs, and from traditional blues music to rap and r&b.

It's a partner dance, so one person leads and one person follows, but there's no specific gender association with those roles, and a lot of folks dance bothâ€”sometimes even switching mid-dance.

It's a super chill dance, and a great way to connect with the music, the people, and the community.
