# your first class

Though west coast swing is a pretty chill dance, it can be a challenge to learn the basics. If you have the opportunity it can be valuable to start with a beginner class.

Most beginner classes don't have any prerequisite—all you have to do is show up. There's typically no need for a partner (the class will rotate partners), and you don't need prior experience in partner dancing.

For your first class you don't need special shoes—just bring a second pair of clean shoes to change into. Sometimes people will just wear socks, too.

At the end of many classes, the instructor will give you the opportunity to record a recap video on your phone. This can be a good way to remember and review what you learned.

To find a first class, [check out your local scene](/docs/category/scenes).
