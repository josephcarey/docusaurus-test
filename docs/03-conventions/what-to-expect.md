# what to expect

A dance convention is a weekend-long event that typically takes place at a hotel. It involves one-off classes (workshops), performances by top-tier dancers, competitions, and a ton of social dancing.

### pass

Usually you purchase one pass that covers most of the events that weekend, except for competitions and sometimes some workshops. The schedule is usually available online

### hotel

Usually the event has an arrangement with the host hotel to provide a special room rate. Most attendees will stay at the hotel; often times splitting two queen beds between four roommates to save on costs.

### transport

Most events take place in large citiesâ€”if it's local to you or close enough to drive, great! But often times it means flying.
